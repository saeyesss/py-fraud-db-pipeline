Identity document fraud represents a significant challenge across banking, border control, and identity verification systems. With the increasing sophistication of forgery techniques, manual inspection is becoming less reliable and more time-consuming. Our project tackles this problem by developing an automated fraud detection system that combines deep learning with database integration. We leveraged a multi-modal approach that simultaneously analyzes both the visual elements of identity documents and their associated metadata. By preprocessing the IDNet dataset and implementing a dual-stream neural network architecture, we created a system capable of identifying fraudulent documents with remarkable accuracy.
